# Project
Banking Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis
Developed algorithms for telecommunication service vendors to predict customer churn based on labeled data via python programming
preprocessed data set by data cleaning, categorical feature transformation by One-hot Encoding, standardization and normalization, etc
Trained supervised machine learning model Logistic regression including K-Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest, and applied regularization with optimal parameters to avoid overfitting problem
Evaluated model performance of classification via k-fold cross-validation and analyzed the feature importance to identify top factors that influenced the results
Concluded that age and estimated salary are the most important features and the company can make better decision based on these information
